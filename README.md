# Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection
Univariate Time Series Anomaly Detection on AirQuality data from Kaggle,
This paper implements three different methods - prediction, statistics and clustering, using various Machine learning models -
1. Autoregressive Integral Moving Average (ARIMA), 
2. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and 
3. Density-based spatial clustering of 
applications with noise (DBSCAN), 
to detect these anomalies and visualise them as graphs.

a short-term 2 memeber team project at Stockholm University shared with my coleague Swathi.
